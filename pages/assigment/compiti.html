♫ Peeragogical approch to music Education ♫</span></li>
<li>Context:</li>
<p>Schools of Music, Conservatories, Public and private area.</p>
<li>Problem:</li>

<p>Often, piano students are frustrated by difficult of learning music. They play their music over and over, hoping that they will eventually get it right. Then, when they continue to have difficulty, they give up, believing that they are simply not talented. While talent is certainly an important aspect of success at the piano, in many cases such talent to emerge it needs to be tickled in different pedagogical approaches and methods for each of us.  The following research is my contribution in order  to Design and Development -<a href="http://peeragogy.org"> Peeragogical </a> Educational Technology- applied on musical studies.</p>
<li>Why it is so challenging and why it is important:</li>

The people are free-range learners. Formal learning takes place in classrooms; informal learning happens everywhere. A workscape is a learning ecology. As the environment of learning, a workscape includes the workplace. In fact, a workscape has no boundaries. No two workscapes are alike. Your workscape may include a dedicated area at school or, thanks to new technologies hypothetically everywhere. My workscape and <a href="http://peeragogia.github.io/Manuale-V3/italy/it-3-ilportale.html">  class project </a> for example It will be design in a public park by reinventing the space itself. Developing this "Urban learning Point" concept it will increase our common city's values and and learning opportunities. The challenge is to create and protect this open environment. In an ideal Workscape, piano students can easily find training "locally or on-line", information and exercise they need, learning is fluid.</p>

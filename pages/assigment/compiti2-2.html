Now that you have your learning challenge, it is time to start brainstorming. Yes, of course you will think about the best way to respond to your learning challenge, but now it's time to approach it from a different angle. Right now, we want you to <strong>think about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">worst</span> intervention ever for your learning challenge</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Here are just a few of the questions you may want to consider</strong>:&nbsp;</span>How can you make things as difficult as possible for your learners?&nbsp;How can you design an intervention that will make it hard or undesirable for them to learn? How can you make the worst assessment possible? How can you make it hard for teachers or students to understand their progress? <strong>Do not just put up barriers; instead try to be counterproductive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Be creative! There is a method to our madness and we will tell you about it. However, first we want you to try this fun thought exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For the deliverable</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Explain how this terrible intervention addresses your learning challenge. Why is it the worst intervention ever?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Please include a picture or any other visual material if relevant. This will help your classmates understand why your intervention is the worst fit for your learning challenge.&nbsp;</span>

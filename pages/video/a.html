                            Muhammad Yunus is the Grameen founder. He was born on 28th June, 1940 in the village of Bathua, Chittagong, the business centre of what was then Eastern Bengal. He was the 3rd of 14 children of whom five died in infancy. His father was a successful goldsmith. He always encouraged his sons to seek higher education. But his biggest influence was Sufia Khatun â€“ his mother, who always helped the poor people that knocked on their door. This inspired him to commit himself to eradication of poverty. His early childhood years were spent in the village. His family moved to the city of Chittagong, where his father had the jewelery business in 1947.

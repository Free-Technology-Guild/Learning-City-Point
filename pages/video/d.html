                           Klopfer’s research focuses on the development and use of computer games and simulations for building understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The games that he works on are designed to build understanding of scientific practices and concepts as well as critical knowledge, using both mobile and web-delivered game platforms. In the realm of simulations, Klopfer’s work focuses on students understanding complex systems through, and connecting computer programming with, scientific practice, critical thinking, and real-world issues. He is the co-author of the books, Adventures in Modeling and The More We Know, as well as the author of Augmented Learning. Klopfer is also the co-founder and past president of the non-profit Learning Games Network.

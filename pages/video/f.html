                           Judy oversees design, development, and research for several projects involving games and simulations, and their integration into formal or informal learning settings. Her work includes overseeing the TaleBlazer software platform, a toolkit and support materials which enable users to make and play their own location-based, augmented reality (AR) games. Judy’s research interests include location-based games, ubiquitous “casual” games, mobile games, and more generally with digital-materials which foster engagement with STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Judy also leads professional development training workshops for educators who want to implement STEP Lab projects. She also enjoys collaborating with other institutions (including zoos, nature centers, libraries, science museums, living history museums, and K-12 classrooms) to develop experimental learning offerings. Prior to becoming a researcher at MIT, her work included television and web production, and content development for educational toys. She holds a B.A. in American Studies from Yale University, and an Ed.M. in Technology Innovation, and Education (T.I.E.) from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

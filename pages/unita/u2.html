<strong>Welcome to Unit 2!</strong>
<p>Professor Klopfer introduces the question of what learning looks like and the idea of moving from novice to expert status. The role of a teacher or educator is to scaffold that process of deep learning to bring learners to a state of mastery, and technology is one tool that can help do that.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; What is Learning?: </strong>Professor Klopfer explores&nbsp;what learning looks like and what it means to become an expert.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching for Understanding:&nbsp;</strong>Judy Perry, who you met in Unit 1, talks with Professor David Perkins about the Teaching for Understanding approach,&nbsp;a framework for planning activities that will encourage deep learning.</li>
<li><strong>SimCalc: </strong>Dr. Jeremy Roschelle tells us about SimCalc,&nbsp;a software tool for math learning, and how it was scaled up.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Tutors:&nbsp;</strong>Professor Kurt VanLehn introduces intelligent tutoring systems, explaining how they work and&nbsp;how they can help guide students</li>
</ul>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLMkeNskY1k">David Perkins, Carl H. Pforzheimer, Jr. Research Professor of Teaching and Learning at Harvard Graduate School of Education, explains why all educators want to teach for understanding and how this is different from routine learning. The challenge is designing lessons that get students to "think with what they know." He presents his framework created to help teachers support this deep learning process.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pq5hCb9iODc">Dr. Jeremy Roschelle, co-director of the Center for Technology in Learning at SRI International, tells the story of SimCalc</a>. By starting with graphs instead of equations, SimCalc draws people in using the learning theory of multiple representations. Jeremy describes how the design of SimCalc changed as his team understood more about how people learn math.</p>
        </a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBhvt4MhtB8">Professor Kurt VanLehn, the Diane and Gary Tooker Chair for Effective Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math at Arizona State University, explains what an intelligent tutoring system is and describes the varying levels of sophistication and interaction that exist in these systems. He talks about what it takes to create an intelligent tutoring system and how it can help students learn by providing useful feedback.</a></li>

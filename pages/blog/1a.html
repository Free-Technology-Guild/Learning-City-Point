<strong>Name:</strong> Learning City Point:
<br></br> 
<strong>Problem:</strong>
To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with experts in the field, this course explores educational technologies, outlines the theories that influence their development, and examines their use.
<br></br> 
<strong>MIT Course Wrap:</strong>
A project contributor can summarizes what has happened recently in the MOOC stream, making progress comprehensible to participants who have not been following all of the details. If they are kept up to date, a project’s landing page and Roadmap also serve as a sort of “wrapper”, telling people what resources they can expect to find in the class and how they can participate and contribute.
<br></br> 
<strong>Rationale:</strong>
The wrapper must check the public summaries of the #GROOC #edX   class from time to time to make sure that they accurately represent the facts on the ground.
<br></br> 
<strong>Resolution:</strong>
According to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, for free/open “commons-based” projects to work, it is vital to have both:
<ol>
<li>The ability to contribute small pieces;</li>
<li>Something that stitches those pieces together @coases-penguin.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The wrapper helps perform this integrative stitching function, which is often much more challenging than the job of breaking things down into pieces or just doing one of the small pieces.
